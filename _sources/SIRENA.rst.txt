Purpose
********

SIRENA (*Software Ifca for Reconstruction of EveNts for Athena X-IFU*) is a software package developed to reconstruct the energy of the incoming X-ray photons after their detection in the `X-IFU <http://x-ifu.irap.omp.eu/>`_ TES detector of the future ESA `Athena <https://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/en>`_ mission (but it is equally valuable for other TES detectors). This is done by means of two tools called :ref:`teslib` and :ref:`tesrecons`, which are mainly two wrappers to pass a data file to the SIRENA tasks; :ref:`teslib` builds the library with the optimal filters to reconstruct the energies with :ref:`tesrecons`.

Initially, SIRENA was integrated in the `SIXTE <http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/research/sixte>`_ end-to-end simulations environment, running on simulated data from SIXTE or XIFUSIM (available for the XIFU consortium members upon request at `sixte-xifusim@lists.fau.de <sixte-xifusim@lists.fau.de>`_). Currently, SIRENA is no longer integrated into either SIXTE or XIFUSIM but it continues to process their simulated data and requires the `SIXTE software <https://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/sixte/sixte-beta/>`_ as well as the `XIFU instrument files <https://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/sixte/sixte-beta/>`_. Similarly, SIRENA can handle real data from laboratory measurements, provided that the data are stored in FITS files in a format compatible with SIRENA.

The SIRENA software is regularly updated and beta versions are often uploaded to a `SIRENA GitHub repository <https://github.com/bcobo/SIRENA>`_.

Auxiliary Files
===============

All the :ref:`reconstruction methods <reconMethods>` used by SIRENA software rely on the existence of a *library* created from a set of data calibration files. In addition, some methods require also a file with the *noise data*. Let's describe these auxiliary files in detail.

.. _noise:

:pageblue:`Noise file`
------------------------

The detector **noise file** is built by the tool :ref:`gennoisespec` from a a long stream of data. This stream is ingested in :ref:`gennoisespec`, which generates the noise current spectral density, and the weight matrices if it is required, from pulse-free data (removing pulses in case it is necessary).

**1) Calibration Stream Simulation**

When working with simulated data, the first step is to create a photon list by for example using the SIXTE tool ``tesgenimpacts`` which create a :ref:`piximpact file <pixImpactFig>` of zero-energy photons:

::

    > tesgenimpacts PixImpList=noise.piximpact opmode=const tstop=1.0 EConst=0. dtau=1
    
.. _pixImpactFig:

   :width: 50%  

.. figure:: images/NoisePiximpact2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 50%

   Piximpact file of zero-energy photons.
  
The second step involves simulating the noise stream, which can be achieved by using the XIFUSIM tool ``xifusim`` (:cite:`Kirsch2022`) with the option `simnoise=y`, simulating fake impacts on the detector based on its physics and generating a noise data stream divided into records:
  
::

    > xifusim PixImpList=noise.piximpact Streamfile=noise.fits tstop=simulationTime acbias=no\
    XMLfilename=myfileXF.xml trig_reclength=10000 simnoise=y

.. _noise-records:
      
.. figure:: images/stream2triggers.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
   
   Noise file triggered into records of 10000 samples by using ``xifusim``.

**2) Noise spectrum and weight matrices generation**

In :ref:`gennoisespec`, data analysis is performed on a per-record basis. When pulses are detected within a record, this tool :ref:`finds <detect>` and filters them out, retaining only the pulse-free intervals whose size is determined by the input parameter :option:`intervalMinSamples` (the hidden input parameter :option:`pulse_length` further specifies the portion of the record rejected due to a detected pulse). In cases where no pulses are present, the record is divided into pulse-free intervals, the size of which is also controlled by this parameter :option:`intervalMinSamples`.

Once the pulse-free intervals have been defined, a long noise interval is constructed by aggregating these pulse-free intervals in order to calculate the noise baseline. Additionally, if :option:`rmNoiseInterval` = *yes*, the noise intervals with excessively high standard deviation are discarded.

On one hand, the tool computes the FFT of the non-discarded pulse-free intervals (over the unfiltered data) and averages them. Only a specific number of intervals (input parameter :option:`nintervals`) will be utilized. The noise spectrum density is stored in the *NOISE* and *NOISEALL* HDUs in the *noise data* file.

::
    
    > gennoisespec inFile=noise.fits outFile=noiseSpec.fits intervalMinSamples=pulseLength \
    nintervals=1000 pulse_length=pulseLength
                
.. _noiseSpec:

.. figure:: images/NoiseSpec.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%
   
   Noise spectrum (see noise file :ref:`description <outNoise>`)

On the other hand, if :option:`weightMS` = *yes* the tool calculates the covariance matrix of the noise, :math:`V^n`, whose elements are expectation values (:math:`E[路]`) of two-point products for a pulse-free data sequence :math:`{di}` (over the unfiltered data) (:cite:`Fowler2015`)

.. math::

	V^n_{ij}=E[d_i d_j]-E[d_i]E[d_j]

.. math::

	W^n = (V^n)^{-1}
	
The weight matrix :math:`W^n` is the inverse of the covariance matrix, :math:`(V^n)^{-1}`. The weight matrices for different lenghts, **Wx**, are stored in the *WEIGHTMS* HDU in the *noise data* file. The lengths x will be base-2 values and will vary from the base-2 system value closest-lower than or equal-to the :option:`intervalMinSamples` decreasing until 2.

.. _noiseSpec2:

.. figure:: images/WeightMatrix.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 80%
   
   Noise weight matrix (see noise file :ref:`description <outNoise>`)

:ref:`gennoisespec` also adds the ``BSLN0`` and ``NOISESTD`` keywords to the *NOISE* HDU in the *noise data* file. They store the mean and the standard deviation of the noise (calculated from the long noise interval).

If the noise spectrum or the weight matrices are to be created from a data stream containing pulses, care should be taken with the parameters :ref:`scaleFactor <scaleFactor_gennoisespec>`, :ref:`samplesUp <samplesUp_gennoisespec>` and :ref:`nSgms <nSgms_gennoisespec>`, which are responsible for the detection process.

.. If the noise spectrum or the weight matrices are to be created from a data stream containing pulses, care should be taken with the parameters :option:`scaleFactor`, :option:`samplesUp` and :option:`nSgms` (:ref:`gennoisespec`), which are responsible for the detection process.

The sampling rate is calculated using certain keywords in the input FITS file. For ``tessim`` simulated data files, tha sampling rate is derived from the ``DELTAT`` keyword, where *samplingRate=1/deltat*. For ``xifusim`` simulated data files, each detector type defines a master clock-rate, ``TCLOCK``, and the sampling rate is calculated either from a given decimation factor ``DEC_FAC`` (FDM and NOMUX) as *samplingRate=1/(tclock路dec_fac)*, or from the row period ``P_ROW`` and the number of rows ``NUMROW`` (TDM) as *samplingRate=1/(tclock路numrow路p_row)*. In the case of old simulated files, the sampling rate could be retrieved from the ``HISTORY`` keyword in the *Primary* HDU. If the sampling frequency cannot be obtained from the input file, a message will prompt the user to include the ``DELTAT`` keyword (inverse of the sampling rate) in the input FITS file before rerunning the process.
      
.. _library:

:pageblue:`Template Library`
------------------------------

The purpose of the **library** is to store detector pulse magnitudes (templates, covariance matrices, optimal filters...) at different calibration energies, enabling their subsequent use for the reconstruction of input pulses of unknown energy.

To construct this library, a bunch of monochromatic pulses at varying energies are simulated using ``tesconstpileup`` (which now generates a *piximpact* file containing pairs of pulses with constant separation) and either ``tessim`` or ``xifusim`` (which simulate the detector physics).

**1) Calibration Files simulation**

The typical run commands to create these calibration files for a given energy *monoEkeV* and a given (large) *separation* in samples between the pulses would be as follows

::

  > tesconstpileup PixImpList=calib.piximpact XMLFile=tes.XML timezero=3.E-7\
  tstop=simulationTime offset=-1 energy=monoEkeV pulseDistance=separation\
  TriggerSize=tsize sample_freq=samplingFreq
  
where *simulationTime* should be large enough to simulate around 20000 isolated pulses, and *tsize* is the size of every simulation stream containing the isolated pulse.

As in the noise simulation, either SIXTE (``tessim``) or XIFUSIM (``xifusim``) are suitable for the task.

::

  > tessim PixID=pixelNumber PixImpList=calib.piximpact Streamfile=calib.fits tstart=0. \
  tstop=simulationTime triggertype='diff:3:100:suppress' triggerSize=tsize \
  PixType=file:mypixel_configuration.fits acbias=yes
    
where *suppress* is the time (in samples) after the triggering of an event, during which `tessim` will avoid triggering again (see figure below).

::

  > xifusim PixImpList=calib.piximpact Streamfile=calib.fits tstart=0. tstop=simulationTime \
  XMLfilename=myfileXF.xml trig_reclength=tsize trig_n_pre=PreBufferSize \
  trig_n_suppress=suppress acbias=no sample_rate=samplingFreq simnoise=y

    Parameters involved in triggering into records from ``tesconstpileup`` to ``tessim`` and ``xifusim``.

..    Parameters involved in triggering into records from ``tesconstpileup`` to ``tessim`` and ``xifusim`` [#]_.

..
   .. [#] Previous figure is equivalent in ``xifusim`` replacing *triggerSize*, *suppress* and *PreBufferSize* by *trig_reclength*, *trig_n_suppress* and *trig_n_pre* respectively.
  
The simulated calibration files are now FITS files with only one HDU called *RECORDS* [#]_ populated with four columns: **TIME** (arrival time of the event), **ADC** (digitized current), **PIXID** (pixel identification) and **PH_ID** (photon identification, for debugging purposes only).

.. figure:: images/records.png
   :align:  center
   :scale: 50%

   Records in calibration file by using ``tessim``.
   
.. [#] If XIFUSIM is utilized, the calibration files encompass not only the *TESRECORDS* HDU containing events records (instead of *RECORDS* in ``tessim``), but also additional HDUs such as *GEOCHANNELPARAM*, *TESPARAM*, *SQUIDPARAM*, *WFEEPARAM*, *DREPARAM*, *ADCPARAM* and *TRIGGERPARAM*. Recent versions of XIFUSIM introduce an **EXTEND** column, indicating the presence of additional data in a record that necessitates reading from subsequent line(s) to complete it. Depending on the simulator version, the **PH_ID** column may be either fixed-length or variable-length, with varying dimensions; in the latest XIFUSIM simulated files, the **PH_ID** column is of fixed length, containing three identifiers for the first three photons in each corresponding record.
   
**2) Library construction**

After generating the calibration files for all calibration energies ranging from 1 to N, the library is constructed using the ``teslib`` wrapper tool. To execute it with the SIRENA code:

::

  > teslib Recordfile=calib.fits TesEventFile=evtcal.fits largeFilter=8192 \
  LibraryFile=library.fits clobber=yes monoenergy=monoEeV_1 EventListSize=1000\
  NoiseFile=noiseSpec.fits scaleFactor=sF samplesUp=sU nSgms=nS \
  addCOVAR=yes/no addINTCOVAR=yes/no addOFWN=yes/no
                
  [.....]
  
  > teslib Recordfile=calib.fits TesEventFile=evtcal.fits largeFile=8192\
  LibraryFile=library.fits clobber=yes monoenergy=monoEeV_N EventListSize=1000\
  NoiseFile=noiseSpec.fits scaleFactor=sF samplesUp=sU nSgms=nS \
  addCOVAR=yes/no addINTCOVAR=yes/no addOFWN=yes/no
  
The parameters of ``teslib`` for the library creation process are:

If the interval size (:option:`intervalMinSamples`) used to create the noise exceeds this value, the noise will be decimated accordingly when used to pre-calculate the optimal filters or the covariance matrices. Conversely, if the interval size is shorter, an error will be raised
* :ref:`EnergyMethod <EnergyMethod_teslib>`: energy calculation Method: OPTFILT (Optimal filtering), 0PAD (0-padding), I2R and I2RFITTED (Linear transformations) (I2R/I2RFITTED are incompatible with :option:`addCOVAR`/:option:`addINTCOVAR` = yes)
* :ref:`Ifit <Ifit_teslib>`: constant to apply the I2RFITTED conversion
* :option:`FilterMethod`:filtering Method: F0 (deleting the zero frequency bin) or B0 (deleting the baseline)
* :option:`intermediate` and :option:`detectFile`: optionally write intermediate file and name of this intermediate file
* :option:`tstartPulse1` and :option:`tstartPulse2` and :option:`tstartPulse3`: start time (in samples) of the first, second and third pulse in the record (0 if detection should be performed by the system; greater than 0 if provided by the user)

.. _libraryColumns:

**3) Library structure**

The library FITS file comprises 3 HDUs called *LIBRARY*, *FIXFILTT*, *FIXFILTF* which are always present, and 2 HDUs named *PRCLCOV* and *PRCLOFWN* which are optional depending on the input parameters :option:`addCOVAR` and :option:`addOFWN`.

*LIBRARY* always includes the following columns:

* **ENERGY**: energies (in eV) in the library
* **PHEIGHT**: pulse heights of the templates
* **PULSE**: templates (obtained by averaging many signals) with baseline. Its length corresponds to the closest lower or equal base-2 value to :option:`largeFilter`
* **PULSEB0**: baseline-subtracted templates derived from **PULSE**
* **MF**: matched filters (energy-normalized templates) derived from **PULSE**
* **MFB0**: baseline-subtracted matched filters derived from **MFB0**

The number of columns in *LIBRARY* may increase depending on input parameters or if the library incorporates multiple calibration energies:

* **PLSMXLFF**: long templates according to :option:`largeFilter` (obtained by averaging many signals) with baseline. If :option:`largeFilter` is a power of 2, it will not appear (only **PULSE** will be present)

|

* **DAB**: vectors :math:`S_{\alpha}- E_{\alpha}(S_{\beta}-S_{\alpha})/(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})`, :math:`d(t)_{\alpha\beta}` in :ref:`first order approach <optimalFilter_NSD>`. It appears if the library includes multiple calibration energies, not just one
* **DABMXLFF**: **DAB** according to :option:`largeFilter`. If :option:`largeFilter` is a power of 2, it will not appear, even if the library includes multiple calibration energies
* **SAB**: vectors :math:`(S_{\beta}-S_{\alpha})/(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})`, :math:`s(t)_{\alpha\beta}` in :ref:`first order approach <optimalFilter_NSD>`. It appears if the library includes multiple calibration energies, not just one

..
   * **PLSMXLFF**: long templates according to :option:`largeFilter` (obtained averaging many signals) with baseline. If :option:`largeFilter` is equal to :option:`PulseLength` it does not appear

If :option:`preBuffer` = yes, the library will be constructed using the filter lengths and their respective preBuffer values extracted from the XML input file. The length of columns *PULSE*, *PULSEB0*, *MF*, *MFB0*, *PAB* and *DAB* will be determined by the maximum *filtlen* values found in the latest XML files, with *filtlen* values representing the lengths of filters based on their grading.

The *FIXFILTT* HDU comprises pre-calculated optimal filters in the time domain for various lengths. These are derived from the matched filters (*MF* or *MFB0* columns) in the **Tx** columns, or from the *SAB* column in the **ABTx** columns. The lengths *x* are based on values in the binary system and range from the closest lower or equal base-2 system value to the specified :option:`largeFilter`, gradually decreasing down to 2. Additionally, when :option:`largeFilter` is not a base-2 value, columns **Txmax** and **ABTxmax** are included, where *xmax* = :option:`largeFilter`. The *FIXFILTT* HDU consistently includes **Tx** columns but **ABTx** columns are present only if multiple calibration energies (not just one) are incorporated in the library. If :option:`preBuffer` = yes, the number of **Tx** columns (or **ABTx** columns) corresponds to the different grades specified in the XML input file.

The *FIXFILTF* HDU comprises pre-calculated optimal filters in the frequency domain for various lengths. These are derived from the matched filters (*MF* or *MFB0* columns) in the **Fx** columns, or from the *SAB* column in the **ABFx** columns. The lengths *x* are based on values in the binary system and range from the closest lower or equal base-2 system value to the specified :option:`largeFilter`, gradually decreasing down to 2. Additionally, when :option:`largeFilter` is not a base-2 value, columns **Fxmax** and **ABFxmax** are included, where *xmax* = :option:`largeFilter`. The *FIXFILTF* HDU consistently includes **Fx** columns but **ABFx** columns are present only if multiple calibration energies (not just one) are incorporated in the library. If :option:`preBuffer` = yes, the number of **Fx** columns (or **ABFx** columns) corresponds to the different grades specified in the XML input file.

The *PRCLCOV* HDU contains :ref:`pre-calculated values obtained by utilizing the noise weight matrix derived from the subtraction of the model from pulses <COVAR>` for various lengths, **PCOVx** columns. These lengths *x* are represented by base-2 values, ranging from the closest lower or equal base-2 system value to the specified :option:`largeFilter`, gradually decreasing down to 2.

The *PRCLOFWN* HDU contains :ref:`pre-calculated values obtained by utilizing the noise weight matrix derived from noise intervals <optimalFilter_WEIGHTN>` for various lengths, **OFWNx** columns. These lengths *x* are represented by base-2 values, ranging from the closest lower or equal base-2 system value to the specified :option:`largeFilter`, gradually decreasing down to 2.


.. _inputFiles:

Input Files
============

The input data (simulated or laborarory data) files, currently required to be in FITS format, are a sequence of variable length *RECORDS*, containing at least a column for the **TIME** of the digitalization process, a column for the detector current (**ADC**) at these samples, a column for the pixel identification (**PIXID**) and a column for the photon identification (**PH_ID**). In the simulated files every record (file row) is the result of an initial triggering process done by the SIXTE simulation tool ``tessim`` [#]_.

.. _records:

.. figure:: images/records.png
   :align:  center
   :scale: 50%
   
   Simulated data (pulses) in FITS records by using ``tessim``.
   
.. [#]  When working with ``xifusim``, the *TESRECORDS* HDU (alongside others HDUs such as *GEOCHANNELPARAM*, *TESPARAM*, *SQUIDPARAM*,etc.) is utilized instead of *RECORDS* HDU.

The sampling rate is determined using specific keywords within the input FITS file. For ``tessim`` simulated data files, the sampling rate is calculated as *samplingRate=1/deltat*, where *deltat* denotes the ``DELTAT`` keyword. In the case of ``xifusim`` simulated data files, each detector type defines a master clock-rate, ``TCLOCK``; the sampling rate is then calculated either from a given decimation factor, ``DEC_FAC`` (for FDM and NOMUX), as *samplingRate=1/(tclock路dec_fac)*, or from the row period, ``P_ROW``, and the number of rows, ``NUMROW`` (for TDM), as *samplingRate=1/(tclock路numrow路p_row)*. For older simulated files, the sampling rate could be extracted from the ``HISTORY`` keyword in the *Primary* HDU or from the input XML file. If the sampling frequency cannot be obtained from the input files, a message prompts the user to include the ``DELTAT`` keyword (representing the inverse of the sampling rate) in the input FITS file before rerunning the process.

.. _reconOutFiles:
	
Output Files
==============
	
The reconstructed energies for all detected events are stored in an output FITS file, controlled by the ``tesrecons`` input parameter :option:`TesEventFile`. Each event is saved in a separate row within the HDU named *EVENTS*, containing the following information (some of which may only be useful for development purposes):

* **TIME**: arrival time of the event (in s)

* **SIGNAL**: energy of the event (in keV). A post-processing energy calibration is necessary due to the non-linearity of the detector

* **AVG4SD**: average of the first 4 samples of the derivative of the pulse

* **ELOWRES**: energy provided by a low-resolution energy estimator filtered with an 8-sample-length filter (with lags) (in keV). If there is no 8-length filter in the library, ELOWRES=-999.

* **GRADE1**: length of the filter utilized, defined as the distance to the subsequent pulse (in samples), or the pulse length if the next event is beyond this value, or if there are no additional events in the same record

* **GRADE2**: distance to the start time of the preceding pulse (in samples). If the pulse is the first event, this value is fixed to the pulse length

* **PHI**: arrival phase (offset relative to the central point of the parabola) (in samples)

* **LAGS**: number of samples shifted to find the maximum of the parabola

* **BSLN**: mean value of the baseline generally preceding a pulse (according the value in samples of :option:`LbT`)

* **RMSBSLN**: standard deviation of the baseline generally preceding a pulse (according the value in samples of :option:`LbT`)

* **PIXID**: pixel number

* **PH_ID**: photon number identification of the first three photons in the respective record for cross-matching with the impact list

* **GRADING**: pulse grade (depending on number of gradings in XML file, in general, VeryHighRes=1, HighRes=2, IntRes=3, MidRes=4, LimRes=5, LowRes=6 and Rejected=-1)

..
   * **RISETIME**: rise time of the event (in s).

   * **FALLTIME**: fall time of the event (in s).

There are additional columns (**RISETIME**, **FALLTIME**, **RA**, **DEC**, **DETX**, **DETV**, **SRC_ID**, **N_XT** and **E_XT**) prepared to potentially store additional information in the future.

In all output files generated by SIRENA (including the noise spectrum file, library file, and reconstructed events file), the keywords ``CREADATE`` and ``SIRENAV`` indicate the date of file creation and the SIRENA version used execution, respectively.

If :option:`intermediate` = 1, an intermediate FITS file containing useful information (primarily for development purposes) will be created. The intermediate FITS file comprises 2 or 3 HDUs, *PULSES*, *TESTINFO* and *FILTER*. The *PULSES* HDU inlcudes information about identified pulses: **TSTART**, **I0** (the pulse itself), **TEND**, **QUALITY**, **TAURISE**, **TAUFALL** and **ENERGY**. The *TESTINFO* HDU contains **FILDER** (the low-pass filtered and differentiated records) and **THRESHOLD** utilized in detection. If deemed necessary (when :option:`OFLib` = no or :option:`OFLib` = yes, :option:`filtEeV` = 0 and the number of energies in the library FITS file exceeds 1), the *FILTER* HDU will encompass the optimal filter used for calculating each pulse energy (**OPTIMALF** or **OPTIMALFF** column, depending on the time or frequency domain), along with its length (**OFLENGTH**).

************************
Reconstruction Process
************************

The energy reconstruction of the input pulse energies is carried out using the tool ``tesrecons`` through three main blocks:

* Event Detection
* Event Grading
* Energy Determination

.. _detect:

Event Detection
================

The initial stage of SIRENA processing involves a refined detection process conducted over each *RECORD* in the input file to identify missing (or secondary) pulses that may overlay the primary (initially triggered) ones. Two algorithms serve this purpose: the *Adjusted Derivative* (**AD**) (refer to :cite:`Boyce1999`) and the *Single Threshold Crossing* (**STC**) method (implemented in the code to streamline the complexity and computational demands of the AD scheme) (:option:`detectionMode`).

.. _detection_AD:

:pageblue:`Adjusted Derivative`
-------------------------------

The *Adjusted Derivative* method follows these steps:

1.- The record undergoes differentiation, followed by a *median kappa-clipping* process where data values exceeding the median plus *kappa* times the standard deviation of the quiescent signal are iteratively replaced by the median value until no further data points are affected. Subsequently, the threshold is set at the mean value of the clipped data plus :option:`nSgms` times the standard deviation.

.. figure:: images/mediankappaclipping.png
   :align:  center
   :scale: 100%
   

   Median kappa-clipping block diagram (at this stage, *kappa* is hardcoded to 3.).

2.- A pulse is possibly detected whenever the derivarive signal exceeds this threshold.

.. figure:: images/ADskecth_blue.png
   :align:  center
   :scale: 60%
   
   Block diagram illustrating the AD detection process (after threshold establishment).

3.- Based on the first sample of the signal derivative that surpasses the threshold level (*samp1DER*), a template is chosen from the library. Subsequently, the dot product of the pre-detected pulse and the template is calculated over a span of 25 samples at various positions (lags) around the initial starting time of the pulse to better ascertain its accurate tstarting point. Typically, evaluating the dot product at 3 different **lags** [#]_ around the initial detection sample suffices to identify a maximum, and subsequent steps hinge upon whether such a maximum is found or not:

- If no maximum of the dot product is detected, the starting time of the pulse is set to the time when the derivative surpasses the threshold (in this scenario, the *tstart* corresponds to a digitized sample without accounting for potential jitter).
- If a maximum of the dot product is identified, a new starting time of the pulse is determined (utilizing the 3-dot-product results around the maximum to analytically define a parabola and locate its apex). Subsequently, an iterative process commences to select the optimal template from the library, yielding a new starting time with each iteration introducing a different level of jitter. Due to jitter, pulses may fall between digitized sample clock intervals, causing the first derivative sample of the pulse itself to deviate from the value of the first sample crossing the threshold, necessitating correction based on the time shift relative to the digitized samples (*samp1DER correction*).

.. [#] However, in scenarios where residual signals are substantial, the maximum of the dot product may shift towards a secondary pulse, potentially missing the primary detection. Consequently, the maximum number of dot product lags is currently capped at 5.

4.- Each time a sample exceeds the threshold, a check is conducted for the slope of the straight line formed by this sample, its preceding one, and its subsequent one. If the slope is lower than the minimum slope of the templates in the calibration library, the pulse is discarded (as it is likely a residual signal), and a new search is initiated. Conversely, if the slope exceeds the minimum slope of the templates in the calibration library, the pulse is identified as detected.

5.- Once a primary pulse is detected in the record, the system initiates a secondary detection to identify any missing pulses that may be hidden by the primary one. To accomplish this, a model template is selected from the auxiliary library and subtracted at the position of the detected pulse. The first sample of the derivative of the detected pulse (which may differ from the initial one following reallocation performed by the dot product in the previous step) is utilized to once again select the appropriate template from the library. Following the *samp1DER correction* and accounting for jitter, the 100-sample-long template must be aligned with the pulse before subtraction (*template correction*). Subsequently, the search for samples exceeding the threshold recommences.

This process iterates until no further pulses are identified.

If the noise level is significant, the input data can undergo low-pass filtering during the initial stage of event detection. This is achieved using the input parameter :ref:`scaleFactor <scaleFactor_tesrecons>` (:math:`\mathit{sF}`). The low-pass filtering is implemented as a box-car function, representing a temporal averaging window. If the cut-off frequency of the filter is :math:`fc`, the box-car length is calculated as :math:`(1/fc) \times \mathit{samprate}`, where :math:`\mathit{samprate}` represents the sampling rate in Hz.

.. math:: 
    
        f_{c1} &= \frac{1}{pi\cdot\mathit{sF_1}} \\
        f_{c2} &= \frac{1}{pi\cdot\mathit{sF_2}} 
    
for :math:`\mathit{sF_1} < \mathit{sF_2}`

        Low-pass filtering (LPF)
        
If the parameter :ref:`scaleFactor <scaleFactor_tesrecons>` is too large, the band of the low-pass filter becomes excessively narrow, resulting not only in the rejection of noise during filtering but also in the attenuation of the signal.

.. note:: To mitigate this issue, an appropriate cut-off frequency for the low-pass filter must be selected to avoid piling-up the first derivative and to detect as many pulses as possible in the input FITS file. However, filtering introduces signal spreading, necessitating a transformation of the start time of the pulse calculated from the first derivative of the low-pass filtered event (which is affected by the filter-induced spreading) into the start time of the non-filtered pulse.
   
.. _detection_STC:

:pageblue:`Single Threshold Crossing`
-------------------------------------

1.- This alternative detection method also involves comparing the derivative signal to a threshold (established in the same manner as in the step 1 of the previous algorithm).

2.- If :option:`samplesUp` consecutive samples of the derivative surpass this threshold, a pulse is detected.

3.- Following detection, the start time of the detected pulse is determined as the first sample of the derivative that crosses the threshold.

4.- If :option:`samplesDown` consecutive samples of the derivative fall below the threshold, the process of searching for a new pulse begins again.

In contrast to applying either of the last two detection algorithms, for testing and debugging purposes, the SIRENA code can be executed in **perfect detection** mode, omitting the detection stage, provided that simulated pulses (pairs or triplets) are consistently positioned in all the RECORDS. In this scenario, the start sample of the first/second/third pulse in the record is derived from the input parameter(s) :option:`tstartPulse1` [#]_, :option:`tstartPulse2`, :option:`tstartPulse3` (parameters :ref:`scaleFactor <scaleFactor_tesrecons>`, :ref:`samplesUp <samplesUp_tesrecons>`, or :ref:`nSgms <nSgms_tesrecons>` would not be necessary). Currently, subsample pulse rising has not been implemented in the simulations or in the reconstruction code (potentially a subject for future development).

.. [#] :option:`tstartPulse1` can also be a string containing the file name with the start time (in seconds) of each pulse.

.. _grade:

Event Grading
==============

The *Event Grading* stage assesses the quality of the pulses based on their proximity to other events within the same record.

After detecting the events in a particular record and establishing their start times, **grades** are assigned to each event, considering the proximity of adjacent pulses. This classification process follows the information provided in the input :option:`XMLFile`.


..
   This way, pulses are classified as *High*, *Medium*, *Limited* or *Low* resolution and as *Rejected* and *Pileup* pulses. Currently the grading is performed following the information in the input :option:`XMLFile`.


.. _reconMethods:

Event Energy Determination: methods
====================================

Once the input events have been detected and graded, their energy content can be determined. Currently, all events (regardless of their grade) are processed using the same reconstruction method. However, in the future, a different approach could be adopted, such as simplifying the reconstruction for events with lower resolution.

The SIRENA input parameter that controls the applied reconstruction method is :option:`EnergyMethod`, which can take values of *OPTFILT* for Optimal Filtering in Current space, *0PAD* for 0-padding in Current space, *INTCOVAR* for Covariance Matrices, *COVAR* for a first-order approach of the Covariance matrices method, and *I2R* or *I2RFITTED* for Optimal Filtering implementation in (quasi)Resistance space. If optimal filtering is employed and :option:`OFNoise` is set to *WEIGHTN*, the noise weight matrix from noise intervals is used instead of the noise spectral density (:option:`OFNoise` is *NSD*).

.. _optimalFilter_NSD:

:pageblue:`Optimal Filtering by using the noise spectral density`
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the baseline standard technique commonly used for processing microcalorimeter data streams. It relies on two main assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that the detector response is linear, meaning that, the pulse shapes remain identical regardless of their energy, and thus, the pulse amplitude serves as the scaling factor from one pulse to another :cite:`Boyce1999`, :cite:`Szym1993`.

In the frequency domain (as noise can be frequency-dependent), the raw data can be expressed as :math:`D(f) = E \cdot S(f) + N(f)`, where :math:`S(f)` represents the normalized model pulse shape (matched filter), :math:`N(f)` represents the noise spectrum, and :math:`E` is the scalar amplitude for the photon energy.

.. S(f) is template with Baseline (removed in F0 strategy)

The second assumption is that the noise is stationary, meaning it does not vary with time. Consequently, the amplitude of each pulse can be estimated by minimizing (in a weighted least-squares sense) the difference between the noisy data and the model pulse shape. This is achieved by minimizing the :math:`\chi^2` condition:

.. _eqOPT:

.. math::

   \chi^2 = \int \frac{(D(f)-E \cdot S(f))^2}{\langle\lvert N(f)\lvert ^2\rangle} df


In the time domain, the amplitude corresponds to the optimally filtered sum of values within the pulse, expressed as:

.. math::

   E = k \int d(t)\cdot of(t) dt,

where :math:`of(t)` is the time domain representation of the optimal filter in the frequency domain

.. math::

   OF(f) = \frac{S^*(f)}{\langle\lvert N(f)\lvert ^2\rangle}

and :math:`k` is the normalization factor to yield :math:`E` in energy units

.. math::

   k = \int \frac{S(f)\cdot S^{*}(f)}{\langle\lvert N(f)\lvert ^2\rangle} df

Optimal filtering reconstruction can currently be performed in two different implementations: *baseline subtraction* (**B0** in SIRENA wording), where the baseline value (which is read from the ``BASELINE`` keyword in the library file and propagated from the noise file) is subtracted from the signal, and *frequency bin 0* (**F0**), where the frequency bin at *f=0 Hz* is discarded for constructing the optimal filter. Consequentlly, the final filter is effectively zero-summed, resulting in the rejection of the signal baseline (see :cite:`Doriese2009` for a discussion on the effect of this approach on TES energy resolution). This option is controlled by the parameter :option:`FilterMethod`.

**As the X-IFU detector is nonlinear, the energy estimation after applying any filtering method must be transformed to an unbiased estimation by applying a gain scale obtained through the application of the same method to pulse templates at different energies (which is not performed within SIRENA).**

In SIRENA, optimal filters can either be calculated dynamically (*on-the-fly*) or retrieved as pre-calculated values from the calibration library. This option is determined by the input parameter :option:`OFLib`. When :option:`OFLib` = yes, fixed-length pre-calculated optimal filters (**Tx** or **Fx**, or **ABTx** or **ABFx**) are fetched from the library. The selected length **x** corresponds to the base-2 system value closest to, but not exceeding, that of the event being reconstructed or :option:`largeFilter`. Conversely, when :option:`OFLib` = no, optimal filters are computed specifically for the pulse length of the event being analyzed. The length calculation is governed by the parameter :option:`OFStrategy`.

When :option:`OFStrategy` = *FREE*, the filter length is optimized to the maximum available length (referred to as *fltmaxlength*), determined by the position of the following pulse or the pulse length if shorter. For :option:`OFStrategy` = *BYGRADE*, the filter length is chosen based on the pulse grade (currently read from the :option:`XMLFile`). Alternatively, for :option:`OFStrategy` = *FIXED*, a fixed length (specified by the parameter :option:`OFLength`) is used for all pulses. These latter two options are primarily intended for testing and development purposes; a typical operational run with *on-the-fly* calculations employs :option:`OFStrategy` = *FREE*. It is important to note that :option:`OFStrategy` = *FREE* implicitly sets :option:`OFLib` = no, while :option:`OFStrategy` = *FIXED* or :option:`OFStrategy` = *BYGRADE* sets :option:`OFLib` = yes. Furthermore, when :option:`OFLib` = no, a noise file must be provided via the parameter :option:`NoiseFile`, as optimal filters must be computed for each pulse at the required length in this scenario.

..
    OFLib=no (On-the-fly): Matched Filter MF(t) with the closest (>=) length to the pulse length, is read from the library ==> cut to the required length ==> NORMFACTOR is calculated from trimmed MF and the decimated noise ==> short OF is calculated ==> energy :  NOISE file required
    OFLib=yes : OF(t) with the closest (>=) length to the pulse length (NORMFACTOR included) is read from the library ==> energy : NOISE file not required

    OPTIMAL filters saved in the library already contain the NORMFACTOR

In order to reconstruct all events using filters at a single monochromatic energy, the input library should contain only one row with the calibration columns for that specific energy. However, if the input library consists of several monochromatic calibration energies, the optimal filters used in the reconstruction process can be adjusted to the initially estimated energy of the event being analyzed. To achieve this, a first-order expansion of the temporal expression of a pulse at the unknown energy *E* is taken into account:

.. _0n:

.. math::

   d(t,E) = s(t,E_{\alpha}) + b + \frac{(E-E_{\alpha})}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})}[s(t,E_{\beta})- s(t,E_{\alpha})]

..      Therefore, the data are on the top of a baseline and the pulse templates have a null baseline.
	
where :math:`b` represents the baseline level, and :math:`s(t,E_{\alpha}), s(t,E_{\beta})` denote pulse templates (**PULSEB0** columns) at the corresponding energies :math:`E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}`, which encompass the energy :math:`E`. By rearranging terms, we can further simplify the expression:

.. math::

   & d(t)_{\alpha\beta} = s(t,E_{\alpha}) - \frac{E_{\alpha}}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})}[s(t,E_{\beta})-s(t,E_{\alpha})]\\
   & s(t)_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{[s(t,E_{\beta})-s(t,E_{\alpha})]}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})}

then

.. math::

   d(t,E) - d(t)_{\alpha\beta} = E \cdot s(t)_{\alpha\beta} + b

This expression resembles to the previous one for optimal filtering, where now the data :math:`d(t)` is represented by :math:`d(t,E) - d(t)_{\alpha\beta}`, and the role of the normalized template :math:`s(t)` is assumed by :math:`s(t)_{\alpha\beta}`. Consequently, the optimal filters can be constructed based on :math:`s(t)_{\alpha\beta}`.

Once more, :option:`OFStrategy` governs whether the required (*interpolated*) optimal filter (derived from :math:`s(t)_{\alpha\beta}`) is retrieved from the library (at any of the several fixed lengths stored, **Fx** or **Tx** if only one energy is included in the library, or **ABFx** or **ABTx** if multiple energies are included in the library) or if an appropriate filter is computed dynamically *on-the-fly* (:option:`OFStrategy` = *FREE*).

   Decision loop for optimal filter calculation
            
The optimal filtering technique (selected through the input parameter :option:`EnergyMethod`) can be applied in the frequency or time domain with the option :option:`FilterDomain`.

The misalignment between the triggered pulse and the template used for the optimal filter can impact the energy estimation. Since the response is highest when the data and the template align, SIRENA incorporates an option to calculate the energy at three predetermined lags between them, aiming for a more accurate estimate than the sampling frequency allows (:cite:`Adams2009`). This feature is controlled by the input parameter :option:`LagsOrNot`.

.. _optimalFilter_WEIGHTN:

:pageblue:`Optimal Filtering by using the noise weight matrix from noise intervals`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By choosing the input parameter :option:`OFNoise` as **WEIGHTN** the optimal filtering method is going to use the noise weight matrix calculated from noise intervals, :math:`W^n`, rather than the noise spectral density as in :ref:`the previous section <optimalFilter_NSD>`. Using the noise power spectrum (FFT) is also possible, but it introduces an additional wrong assumption of periodicity. The signal-to-noise cost for filtering in the Fourier domain may be small in some cases but it is worth checking the importance of this cost (:cite:`Fowler2017`).

Being :math:`W^n` the noise covariance matrix, the best estimate energy is:

.. math::

   E = e_1^T[M^T \cdot W^n \cdot M]^{-1} M^T \cdot W^n \cdot Y

where :math:`M` is a model matrix whose first column is the pulse shape and the second column is a column of ones in order to calculate the baseline, :math:`Y` is the measured data and :math:`e_1^T \equiv [1, 0]` is the unit vector to select only the term that corresponds to the energy (amplitude) of the pulse.

.. _preBuffer or 0-padding:

:pageblue:`Two experimental approaches: adding a preBuffer or 0-padding`
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In cases where pulses are closer together than the Very High Resolution length, the reconstruction process necessitates the use of shorter optimal filters, resulting in a degradation of the energy resolution, as explored by :cite:`Doriese2009`. To address this issue, two distinct experimental approaches have been devised, namely, variants of Optimal Filtering utilizing the noise spectral density.

**a) Adding a preBuffer:**

Initially, a few signal samples are added before the triggering point to the pulses template, governed by the parameter :option:`preBuffer` = yes. These preBuffer values are aligned with the filter length values specified in the XML file, aiding in the construction of the optimal filter.

.. figure:: images/preBuffer.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 30%

   Adding a preBuffer as a variant of Optimal Filtering by using the noise spectral density


**b) 0-padding:**

Secondly, rather than determining the energy through the scalar product of the short pulse and its corresponding short optimal filter, which is constructed using a template of reduced length, the full filter is consistently utilized. However, in this approach, the full filter, built from a high-resolution-long template, is padded with zeros after the short pulse length. If :option:`EnergyMethod` = `0PAD`, the padding process will be initiated, wherein the filter is padded with zeros from :option:`flength_0pad` onwards.

   0-padding as a variant of Optimal Filtering by using the noise spectral density


.. _rSpace:

:pageblue:`Quasi Resistance Space`
----------------------------------

A novel approach aimed at dealing with the non-linearity inherent in the signals involves transformating the current signal to a (quasi) resistance space prior the reconstruction process  (:cite:`Bandler2006`, :cite:`Lee2015`). This transformation seeks to enhance linearity by mitigating non-linearity arising from the bias circuit, although non-linearity stemming from the Resistance-Temperature transition persists. An additional potential benefit of this approach could be the attainment of a more uniform noise profile across the pulse.

The simulation tool ``tessim`` (:cite:`Wilms2016`) is based on a generic model of the TES/absorber pixel featuring a first-stage read-out circuit. The overarching framework of this model is depicted in the figure below. ``tessim`` performs the numerical solution of the differential equations governing the time-dependent temperature, :math:`T(t)`, and current, :math:`I(t)`, within the TES, as outlined in :cite:`Irwin2005` :

Physics model coupling the thermal and electrical behaviour of the TES/absorber pixel used by ``tessim``.
                         
.. math::

   C \frac{dT}{dt} = -P_b + R(T,I)I^2 + P_{X-ray} + Noise
            
   L \frac{dI}{dt} = V_0 - IR_L - IR(T,I) + Noise

In the electrical equation, :math:`L` is the effective inductance of the readout circuit, :math:`R_L` is the effective load resistor and :math:`V_0` is the constant voltage bias. Under AC bias conditions,
                
   :math:`L =` ``LFILTER`` / ``TTR虏``

   :math:`R_L =` ``RPARA`` / ``TTR虏``
                
   :math:`\mathit{V0} =` ``I0_START`` ( ``R0`` :math:`+ \mathit{R_L} )`
                
and thus the transformation to resistance space would be:
                
.. math::
                
   R = \frac{(\mathit{V0} - I \cdot R_L - L \cdot dI/dt)}{I}

In the aforementioned transformation, the inclusion of a derivative term introduces additional noise, consequently leading to resolution degradation. As a remedy, a new transformation can be implemented by disregarding the circuit inductance ( :cite:`Lee2015` ), effectively suppressing the primary source of non-linearity originating from the first-stage read-out circuit of the detector.

.. math::

   R = \frac{(\mathit{V0} - I \cdot R_L)}{I}

These earlier transformations were previously facilitated by SIRENA. However, SIRENA currently incorporates two transformations accessible through the :option:`EnergyMethod` command line option. The *I2R* transformation regards linearization as a linear scale in the height of the pulses concerning energy, whereas the *I2RFITTED* transformation can also achieve a linear gain scale when reconstructing the signal with a simple filter.

First, let's examine some definitions provided by columns and keywords in simulated data files to enable the transformation to the (quasi) resistance space:

:ADC: Data signal in current space [adu (arbitrary data units)] (column)

*Group 1*:

:``ADU_CNV``: ADU conversion factor [A/adu] (keyword)
:``I_BIAS``: Bias current [A] (keyword)
:``ADU_BIAS``: Bias current [adu] (keyword)

*Group 2*:

:I0_START: Bias current [A] (column)
:``IMIN``: Current corresponding to lowest adu value [A] (keyword)
:``IMAX``: Current corresponding to largest adu value [A] (keyword)
    
* **I2R** transformation

   A linearization, in terms of pulse height versus energy, has been incorporated into SIRENA.
        
   If the *Group 1* info is available in the input FITS file:

      :math:`I=` ``I_BIAS`` + ``ADU_CNV`` * :math:`(\mathit{ADC}`-``ADU_BIAS``:math:`)`

      :math:`\Delta I=` ``ADU_CNV`` * :math:`(\mathit{ADC}`-``ADU_BIAS``:math:`)`
        
   .. math::

      \frac{R}{R0} = \mathit{1} - \left(\frac{abs(\Delta I)/\mathit{I\_BIAS}}{1 + abs(\Delta I)/\mathit{I\_BIAS}}\right)
             
   If the Group 1 information is not available in the input FITS file, Group 2 is utilized. In such instances, the ADU conversion factor must be computed, considering the number of quantification levels (65534):
        
      :math:`aducnv =` (``IMAX`` - ``IMIN``) / 65534
        
      :math:`I = ADC * aducnv` + ``IMIN``
        
      :math:`\Delta I= \mathit{I}` - ``I0_START``
        
* **I2RFITTED** transformation

   Looking for a straightforward transformation that would also yield a linear gain scale, a new transformation *I2RFITTED* was proposed in :cite:`Peille2016`.

   .. math::

      \frac{R}{V0} \backsim \frac{1}{(I_{fit} + ADC)}

..
      \frac{R}{V0} = -10^5\frac{1}{(I_{fit} + ADC)}

    .. If the *Group 1* info is available in the input FITS file:
    
    ..    :math:`I_{fit} =` ``ADU_BIAS``
        
    .. If the *Group 1* info is not available in the input FITS file and the *Group 2* info is used:
    
    ..     :math:`I_{fit} =` ``I0_START`` :math:`/ aducnv`
                                        
    .. These values for :math:`I_{fit}` are a first approach, although it should be confirmed after the instrument calibration.
    The :math:`I_{fit}` value is currently adjustable as an input parameter.

    A scaling factor of :math:`10^5` has been inccluded in the quasi-resistance space (both **I2R** and **I2RFITTED** transformations) to mitigate rounding errors when dealing with very small numbers.

The overall setup of this model is presented in the figure below. ``tessim`` performs the .. numerical solution of the differential equations for the time-dependent temperature, :math:`T(t)`, and the current, :math:`I(t)`, in the TES using :cite:`Irwin2005` :

        .. * **I2RNOL** transformation

        .. In the previous transformation *I2RALL*, the addition of a derivative term increases the noise and thus degrades the resolution. Therefore, a new transformation *I2RNOL* is done where the circuit inductance is .. neglected ( :cite:`Lee2015` ), thus suppressing the main source on non-linearity of the detector that comes from the first stage read-out circuit:

        .. Unknown Pulses U -> remove baseline using keyword in noise file
           Models M: without baseline

In real detectors, the assumptions of linearity and stationary noise do not hold strictly true. Consequentlly, an alternative approach is necessary when dealing with non-stationary noise and nonlinear detectors. In this method a set of calibration points is established through numerous pulse repetitions (:math:`S^i`) at various energies :math:`(\alpha, \beta, ...)`. For these energy points, a pulse model (**PULSEB0** column in the library) is derived by averaging the data pulses :math:`(S_m = <S^i>)`. The deviations of these pulses from the data model :math:`(D^i = S^i - M^i)` are then used to construct a covariance matrix :math:`V^{ij} = <D^iD^j>`, with the inverse of this covariance matrix serving as the weight matrix ( :math:`W` ). It's worth noting that non-stationary noise is more accurately characterized by a full noise covariance matrix as opposed to a simpler Fourier transform ( :cite:`Fixsen2004` ).

An initial energy estimation of the unknown signal data is adequate for identifying the calibration points that encompass it. Through linear interpolation of the weight matrix and the signal, the optimal energy estimate becomes only dependent on the energies of the embracing calibration points, the unknown signal, and additional parameters that can be pre-calculated using the calibration data (see Eq. 2 in :cite:`Fixsen2004`):

.. math::

   E = E_{\alpha} + (E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha}) \frac{r}{3}\left((2DZ - 1) + \sqrt{(2DZ - 1)^2 + \frac{3(2DY - DXD)}{r}}\right)

where :math:`D = U - S_{m,\alpha}`, being :math:`U` the unknown data signal (both :math:`U` and :math:`S_{m,\alpha}` are signals without a baseline, implying that either the baseline is known or remains constant from calibration to measurement time). Certain terms are precomputed using calibration data and incorporated into the :ref:`library <library>` for retrieval during the reconstruction process. In particular: :math:`T = (S_{\beta} - S_{\alpha})`, :math:`t = TW_{\alpha}T`, :math:`X = (W_{\beta} - W_{\alpha})/t`, :math:`Y = W_{\alpha}T/t`, :math:`Z = XT` and :math:`r = 1(ZT)`.

Energy reconstruction with *Covariance Matrices* is selected with input option :option:`EnergyMethod` = **INTCOVAR**.

.. _COVAR:

:pageblue:`Covariance matrices 0(n)`
--------------------------------------

        .. s(t,alpha) or s(t,beta) are templates without baseline
           Dab -> does not mind
           Pab -> no baseline

A first order approximation can be used for the Covariance Matrices method from a first order expansion of the pulse expression at a given *t*:

.. math::

   d(t,E) = s(t,E_{\alpha}) + b + \frac{(E-E_{\alpha})}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})}[s(t,E_{\beta})-s(t,E_{\alpha})]

where :math:`b` is the baseline level, and :math:`s(t,E_{\alpha}), s(t,E_{\beta})` are pulse templates (column **PULSEB0** in the library) at the corresponding energies :math:`E_{\alpha}, E_{\beta}` which embrace the unknown energy :math:`E`.
        
.. math::

   & s(t)_{\alpha\beta} =  \frac{[s(t,E_{\beta})- s(t,E_{\alpha})]}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})} \\
   & d(t)_{\alpha\beta} = s(t,E_{\alpha}) - \frac{E_{\alpha}}{(E_{\beta}-E_{\alpha})}[s(t,E_{\beta})-s(t,E_{\alpha})] \\
   & d(t,E) - d(t)_{\alpha\beta} = E \cdot s(t)_{\alpha\beta} + b
	
resembles an equation of condition in matrix notation :math:`Y = A\cdot X` that for a :math:`\chi^2` problem with the covariance matrices used as weights (:math:`W=V^{-1}`):
        
.. math::
   X = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} x_0 & 1 \\ x_1 & 1 \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ x_m & 1 \end{array} \right] =  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} . & 1 \\ s(t)_{\alpha\beta} & 1 \\ . & 1 \end{array} \right] , Y = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} y_0 \\ y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} . \\ d(t,E)-d(t)_{\alpha\beta} \\ . \end{array} \right] , A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} E \\ b \end{array} \right]

.. math::
   A = [X^T \cdot W \cdot X]^{-1} [X^T \cdot W \cdot Y]

   E = e_1^T[X^T \cdot W \cdot X]^{-1} [X^T \cdot W \cdot Y]

where :math:`e_1^T \equiv [1, 0]` is the unit vector to select only the term that corresponds to the energy (amplitude) of the pulse.

Energy reconstruction with *Covariance Matrices 0(n)* is selected with input option :option:`EnergyMethod` = **COVAR**. If parameter :option:`OFLib` = yes, some components can be used from the precalculated values at the :ref:`libraryColumns <library>` (*PRCLCOV* HDU).
			
.. .. _PCA:

.. :pageblue:`Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`
.. -----------------------------------------------
	
.. 	As the assumptions of the optimal filter technique (linearity and stationary noise) are not strictly correct and the covariance matrix methods are highly resource-demanding, energy reconstruction with *Principal Component Analysis* has been explored (:cite:`Busch2015` and :cite:`Yan2016`).
	
.. 	According to :cite:`Yan2016`, taking a set of non piled-up pulses from the detector (:math:`n=1,...N`), each one sampled in time (:math:`t=1,...T`), a data matrix :math:`D_{T \times N}`
	
.. 	.. math::
	
..                D_{T \times N} = C_{T \times S} \cdot R_{S \times N}
               
        can be represented through the basis set :math:`C_{T \times S}` with *S* characteristics pulse shape factors. :math:`R_{S \times N}` is the weigthing of members of this basis set.
	
        
..         The basis set :math:`C_{T \times S}` can be calculated from the data time covariance :math:`[T \times T]` square matrix. Unlike the (residuals) :ref:`covariance matrix <INTCOVAR>` created for :option:`EnergyMethod` = **INTCOVAR** or **COVAR**, the *pulseaverage* (i.e. model) is not subtracted in :cpp:func:`weightMatrix`.
        
        Since this time covariance matrix is symetric, it can be represented it in terms of a set of eigenvectors :math:`C_{T \times S}` (and eigenvalues weightings). The eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix are the principal components to characterise the information. 
            
        If a subset (*S'*) of eigenvectors can be found (finding patterns depending on the values of the eigenvalues), each pulse could be more compactly represented, not with all the time points *T* but in terms of just its *S'* weighting factors, i.e., the chosen eigenvectors. Once the matrix :math:`C_{T \times S'}` has been determined and inverted, the weighting factors :math:`R_{S' \times N}` of each pulse can be found by 
            
        .. math::
	
..                 R_{S' \times N} = C_{T \times S'}^{-1} \cdot D_{T \times N}
                    
        If the matrix :math:`C_{T \times S}` is constructed to have orthogonal vectors to ease matrix inversion, these eigenvectors could be sorted in order of decreasing statistical significance and a reduced basis set :math:`C_{T \times S'}` could be easily separated from the full basis set :math:`C_{T \times S}`. This reduced set :math:`C_{T \times S'}` of eigenvectors can describe all the significant characteristic pulse shape components.
            
        .. math::
	
..                 R_{S' \times N} = C_{T \times S'}^{-1} \cdot D_{T \times N} = C_{S' \times T}^{T} \cdot D_{T \times N}
                    
        A compressed (and noise-filtered) version of the original data can also then be generated:
        
        .. math::
	
..                     D'_{T \times N} = C_{T \times S'} \cdot R_{S' \times N}
                    
        The next step is understanding how to extract energy information from these 2D scatter plot. In :cite:`Yan2016`, PCA method is applied to a real dataset with Mn :math:`K \alpha` and Mn :math:`K \beta` lines of the Fe-55 source and very different pulse shapes. In order to extract energy information, the weighting matrix :math:`R_{S' \times N}`, restricted to *S'* =2 for simplicity, is examined (see their fig.4 below). Two clusters (elongated by the pulse shape variation) can be seen associated with the Mn :math:`K \alpha` (black) and Mn :math:`K \beta` (blue) lines. By fitting a line (red) to the Mn :math:`K \alpha` cluster, an axis is generated and used to rotate the 2D scatter plot of the weighting matrix so that the clusters are vertical. From the projection onto the X-axis, the energy histogram (right subfigure) is built and thus, the energy can be correlated to a linear combination of the first two PCA components.

           Fig. 4 from :cite:`Yan2016` showing the distribution of elements in the weighting matrix (left) and the energy histogram (right).
            
        In order to show more clearly how to follow the process, we have simulated (using ``tessim``) a data set containing pulses of two different energies, 0.5 and 1 keV (ADC units), that we trim at :math:`T=1024` samples. The first 50 eigenvalues of this dataset are shown in the left subfigure below. According to the eigenvalues, this dataset contains two primary eigenvectors (see the right subfigure below), giving essentially the averages of the pulse shapes (there are two different pulse shapes in the data for two different energies). Higher order eigenvevectors give corrections to these averages and noise correlations.

        The next subfigure on the left shows the distribution of elements from the weighting matrix :math:`R_{S'=2 \times N}`, where components 1 and 2, respectively, are the weighting factors of the first and second eigenvectors. The right subfigure is simply a zoom showing only the 0.5 keV (ADC units) events.

        In the next figure, the :math:`\Delta E` line represents the direction of variable energies and the :math:`ConstantE` line the perpendicular direction which is used to rotate the 2D scatter plot. From the projection onto the X-axis (clusters in red), the energy histograms are built. Since we know the energy difference in eV (the two energies are provided as input parameters :option:`energyPCA1` and :option:`energyPCA2`), it is possible to calculate a conversion factor between arbitrary units to eV.

.. 	PCA has not yet been implemented as a full-functionality :option:`EnergyMethod` (only for testing and development purposes). For the time being, input FITS files to PCA method must have pulses of two different energies which must be provided as input parameters. If it would be necessary, future developments will be done in order to implement this approach in a real-time software.
